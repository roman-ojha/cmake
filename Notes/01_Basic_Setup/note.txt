-> previously with cmake we use to make a makefile
-> where we will write a command that will help to build and created the executable program
-> so here we write to program to do ever task
-> and run 'make' command to build the executable:
*) for windows
    -> But by default there will not exist 'make' command
    -> so for that you have to install 'mingw-get'
    -> https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/Installer/mingw-get/
*) CMake
    -> CMake create build system files
    -> CMake also do the same thing inside the back
    -> it create a command based on we write in cmake
    -> CMake relay on a top level file called 'CMakeLists.txt'
    -> CMake can do ever thing for you to manager you project
    -> we have to provide the build path to build the executable
        cmake [options] <path-to-source>
        cmake [options] <path-to-existing-build>
        cmake [options] -S <path-to-source> -B <path-to-build>
    -> standard way to store build files inside the ./build folder in project directory
    -> for now we will run:
        => cmake -S . -B build
            -> (-S: source on current directory)
            -> (-B: build on build folder)

    -> But now we will write a program in 'CMakeLists.txt' file
